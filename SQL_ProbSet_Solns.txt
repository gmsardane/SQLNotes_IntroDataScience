Using: matrix.db andreuters.db
(a) Select
σ10398_txt_earn(frequency)

SELECT count(*) FROM (
SELECT docid
FROM frequency
WHERE docid = "10398_txt_earn") x;

ANS: 138

(b) select project
πterm(σdocid=10398_txt_earn and count=1(frequency))

SELECT count(*) FROM (
SELECT term
FROM frequency
WHERE docid = "10398_txt_earn" and count = 1) x;

ANS: 110


(c) union
SELECT count(*) FROM (
SELECT * FROM frequency
WHERE docid = "10398_txt_earn" and count = 1
UNION
SELECT * FROM frequency
WHERE docid = '925_txt_trade' and count = 1) x;

ANS: 335

(d) count
SELECT count(*) from(
    SELECT * from FREQUENCY
    WHERE term = 'parliament')


(e) big document

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT docid, sum(count)
FROM frequency
GROUP BY docid
HAVING sum(count) > 300
order by sum(count))

OR
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
SELECT docid, total_term  from(
SELECT docid, sum(count) as total_term
FROM frequency
GROUP BY docid)
WHERE total_term > 300
ORDER BY total_term)

ANS: 107



(f) two words

SELECT count(*) from(
SELECT distinct(docid), count( docid) as CountOf from (SELECT *
FROM frequency
where term = 'transactions' OR TERM='world')
GROUP BY docid)
WHERE COUNTOF = 2

====Another way=====

select count(*)
from (select distinct(docid)
from frequency
where term ='transactions'
and count>0

intersect

select distinct(docid)
from frequency
where term='world'
and count>0
)
;


ANS: 3

(f) Matrix multiplication
SELECT A.row_num, B.col_num, sum(A.value*B.value)
FROM A, B
WHERE A.col_num = B.row_num
GROUP BY A.row_num, B.col_num

ANs: AB(row, col) = AB(2, 3) = 2874


(g) Similarity

SELECT product 
from(
     SELECT f1.docid, f2.docid,  sum(f1.count*f2.count) as product --This is the product of DDT
     from frequency as f1, frequency as f2 
     WHERE f1.term= f2.term AND f1.docid = '10080_txt_crude' and 
     f2.docid= '17035_txt_earn'
     GROUP BY f1.docid, f2.docid)

ANS: 19

(h) More similarity

CREATE VIEW frequency_with_q AS
SELECT * FROM frequency --table q ic constructed
UNION
SELECT 'q' as docid, 'washington' as term, 1 as count 
UNION
SELECT 'q' as docid, 'taxes' as term, 1 as count
UNION 
SELECT 'q' as docid, 'treasury' as term, 1 as count;

SELECT max(product) 
from(
     SELECT f1.docid, f2.docid,  sum(f1.count*f2.count) as product --This is the product of DDT
     from frequency_with_q as f1, frequency_with_q as f2 
     WHERE f1.term= f2.term AND f1.docid = 'q' 
     GROUP BY f1.docid, f2.docid)
